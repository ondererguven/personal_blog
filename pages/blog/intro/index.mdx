# Introduction

Hey there, I've been thinking of creating a space for myself for a long time now. Very recently out of nowhere I got motivated by a good friend of mine, that also manages their own website. So hopefully from now on I'll be adding more stuff here!

I am also very happy to learn basic front-end development as it's a nice change of pace from my job.

## What's the plan?

I have some ideas for the future. Some personal trackers, blog posts, fun stuff etc.

### Running log

First item on my list is to export my runs and present them on this space. I use the Apple Workout app through my Apple Watch to track my runs and export them using Healthfit to Strava. Although that seems like the sufficient setup to me, I'd like to have my own calendar-based dashboard to see my activity.

### Resume

This one's not set-in-stone yet. I might move my resume here at a point so it's easier to access for interested people.

### Guitar tracks

It's been a long time since I played the guitar but I ordered one around the beginning of December and I'm still waiting for the delivery(sigh). Once it arrives, I'm planning to take some music theory lessons and start experimenting with different sounds, genres and electronic music to create my own sound.

### Crypto wallet addresses

Just for fun, I'll probably drop the addresses as a footer in case someone wants to send me some cryptocurrencies.

That kinda wraps it up for now. Let's see how it goes!
